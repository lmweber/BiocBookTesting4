# SpatialExperiment

In this book, we use the [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SpatialExperiment) class from Bioconductor as the main data structure for storing and manipulating datasets.


## SpatialExperiment class

`SpatialExperiment` is a specialized object class for storing SRT datasets within the Bioconductor framework.

The class builds on the more general [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment) class [@Amezquita2020] for single-cell RNA sequencing data, with additional customizations to store spatial information, such as spatial coordinates and image files.

A summary of the `SpatialExperiment` object structure is shown in the following figure. Briefly, a `SpatialExperiment` object consists of (i) `assays` containing expression counts, (ii) `rowData` containing information on features, i.e. genes, (iii) `colData` containing information on spots or cells, including nonspatial and spatial metadata, (iv) `spatialCoords` containing spatial coordinates, and (v) `imgData` containing image data. For spot-based SRT data (e.g. 10x Genomics Visium), a single `assay` named `counts` is used. For molecule-based SRT data (e.g. seqFISH), two `assays` named `counts` and `molecules` can be used.

The following schematic illustrates this structure.

## Additional classes

Additional specialized object classes have been developed by members of the Bioconductor community to store data from molecule-based SRT platforms.

These classes can store and manipulate additional information relevant for molecule-based data, such as cell segmentation geometries and cellular neighbor graphs.
