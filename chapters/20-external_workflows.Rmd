# External workflows

In addition to the workflows in the previous chapters, members of the Bioconductor and other communities have developed additional workflows to showcase new methods or demonstrate their preferred analysis pipelines.

Some of these workflows use Bioconductor packages for some steps, and external packages (e.g. Python packages, or new R packages that are currently only available from GitHub) for other steps. In our view, this demonstrates the flexibility and modularity of the Bioconductor framework -- for example, you can build a workflow that relies on the `SpatialExperiment` data structure and Bioconductor packages for initial preprocessing steps, and then switches to a new package that is only available from GitHub for a new type of downstream analysis.

Here, we will provide links to some of these external workflows as these become available, to provide readers with further examples and alternative perspectives on analyses.
