# Spatially-resolved transcriptomics

Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) refers to high-throughput genomic technologies that enable the measurement of large sets of genes at a large number of spatial locations (e.g. up to thousands of genes at thousands of measurement locations), usually on two-dimensional tissue sections. A number of technological platforms have been developed, each with their unique advantages. SRT was named the [Method of the Year 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-01042-x) by Nature Methods, and has found widespread application in numerous biological systems.

For recent reviews of available platforms, computational analysis methods, and outstanding challenges, see [Bressan et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq4964) or [Moses et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01409-2).


## Overview

In this book, we concentrate on commercially available platforms, since these are most widely used and available. Here, we provide a short overview and introductory details on the platforms used to generate the datasets discussed in this book.

## Sequencing-based platforms

Sequencing-based platforms capture RNAs at a set of spatial measurement locations, tag RNAs with spatial barcodes, and generate a readout by next-generation sequencing.

These platforms can provide up to full-transcriptome feature resolution due to the use of next-generation sequencing. The spatial resolution depends on the size of the capture locations and tissue cell density, and may include multiple cells per measurement location.


### 10x Genomics Visium

The [10x Genomics Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression) platform measures transcriptome-wide gene expression at a grid of spatial locations (referred to as spots) on a tissue capture area. Either fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue may be used. Each spot contains millions of spatially-barcoded capture oligonucleotides, which bind to mRNAs from the tissue. A cDNA library is then generated for sequencing, which includes the spatial barcodes, allowing reads to be mapped back to their spatial locations.

The array dimensions are 6.5mm x 6.5mm, with around 5000 barcoded spots. Spots are 55µm in diameter and spaced 100µm center-to-center in a hexagonal grid arrangement. The number of cells per spot depends on the tissue cell density, e.g. around 0-10 for human brain or ~50 for mouse brain. Each Visium slide contains four tissue capture areas. The following figure provides an illustration.

Histology images generated from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining can be used to identify anatomical and cell morphological features such as the number of cells per spot.

## Molecule-based platforms

Molecule-based platforms identify individual RNAs by in situ hybridization (ISH) or in situ sequencing (ISS) at up to sub-cellular spatial resolution. Counts may be aggregated to cellular (single-cell) spatial resolution by applying manual or data-driven cell segmentation algorithms.

Feature resolution is generally on the order of 100s to 1000s of RNAs, which may be selected as targeted panels of RNAs of interest.
