# Methods for spatially-aware clustering

In this workflow chapter, we compare alternative methods that have been developed for spatially-aware clustering.

This provides a way to demonstrate new methods as these become available and implemented in the Bioconductor framework, and provides users with additional information about the performance of the various methods using a consistent choice of datasets and evaluation metrics.
