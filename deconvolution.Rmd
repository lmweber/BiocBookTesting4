# Spot-level deconvolution

## Background

Spot-level ST data can contain zero, one, or multiple cells per spot, depending on the tissue density and technological platform used. This characteristic of the data influences several steps in analysis pipelines, especially [Quality control] and [Clustering].

This is also a unique characteristic of ST data, which is distinct from single-cell data, so here we cannot apply existing methods from single-cell pipelines.

In this section, we will demonstrate methods to deconvolve cell types per spot. Several methods exist from the bulk RNA-seq literature, as well as new methods designed for ST data.
