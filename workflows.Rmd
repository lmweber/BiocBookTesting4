# (PART) Workflows {-}

# Workflows

This part contains several chapters describing complete workflows for a specific dataset, illustrating how the individual analysis steps fit together. For example, workflows may demonstrate a complete analysis for a specific technological platform, tissue type, or showcase a certain type of methodology. Individual analysis steps are described in more detail in the earlier parts. The workflows re-use code from the individual analysis chapters in a condensed format to provide a convenient overview.
